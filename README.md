# TY BCA Science – Practical Examination Slips Solutions

A structured, student-friendly collection of Third Year BCA (Science) practical examination slip solutions, organized subject‑wise. This repository centralizes solved slips, supporting datasets, Java mini‑projects, and a curated folder of reference books (Nirali publications & related academic texts) to streamline revision and lab exam preparation.

---
## 🎯 Purpose
Provide a single, well‑organized resource to:
- Revise practical concepts quickly before exams/lab vivas.
- Explore solved slips across multiple TY BCA subjects.
- Reuse starter code / logic patterns for similar problems.
- Practice Java programming, R/Data Mining tasks, and Operating System concepts.
- Access standard reference books for theory reinforcement.

> This repository is meant for learning and revision. Always try to solve a slip yourself first before looking at a solution.
